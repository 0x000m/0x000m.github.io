TIMOTHY C. MAY: FROM 'ANARCHY' to 'WELFARISM'

1. Introduction

1.1. Copyright

TIMOTHY C. MAY: FROM 'ANARCHY' to 'WELFARISM', Version 1.0, 2022-05-20. No rights reserved. Please use as you like and kindly link to the original page or the print edition. Please include TIMOTHY C. MAY whenever quoting him from this book. Tim asks in his Cyphernomicon not to put any other name on his words but his, and we ought to respect that.

1.2. Forward

Coming soon (tm).

1.2.1 Stucture and Contents

I've organised this book as an A-Z lexicon of Timothy C. May's most interesting, insightful, and inflammatory online email and forum writing. This writing spans the course of over a decade as has hithero been difficult to access because it is scattered across thousands of emails on old forum archives. I've left out his stand-alone pieces like The Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto or the Cyphernomicon because they are better read in their entirety on their own.

1.3. Acknowledgements 

All material is written by Tim May, except as noted. Research, compilation, forward and editing by 0x000m. This work could not have been done without access to the Cypherpunk Mailing List plaintext archives of Ryan Lackey and their stylized archive on https://cryptoanarchy.wiki/ by Tom Busby.

2. Borders

2.1. "National borders are just speed bumps on the information superhighway."

3. Cyberspace

3.1 "Bashing the cybernetic aspects of our culture is hot these days. I expect Oprah and Sally Jesse to soon be doing shows on this. Children whose mothers are Net addicts, brothers who kill their sisters for using "vi," and jilted cyberlovers who are in relationships with their shrinkwraps."
