4. ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

I'm am fascinated by Gwern Branwen's concept of a "long site." Basically, you work on writing projects that are too hard, too long, or too tedious for most people to do. I've had success as a "blogger" before but looking back on a lot of my writing from 2017-2019, I was struck by how little I cared about it. Gwern asks the question: what would you write or research if you knew you were going to be working on the same thing in twenty years? I'm still figuring that out and this site is my attempt to answer it.

The site is all plain preformatted text with just a dash of CSS. It's probably the simplest website I've ever visited, but it's not for the reason you might think. It's not that I have some hard preference against web design—although indeed I think the web tends to be overdesigned and overtemplated today—but rather that I love tinkering with design so much that I don't get any real work done. It's plain from necessity, though I think you'll find it very practical and readable too, which is all that really matters in web design.
