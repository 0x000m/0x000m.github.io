TIMOTHY C. MAY: FROM 'ANARCHY' to 'WELFARISM'

1. Introduction

1.1. Copyright

     No rights reserved. Please use as you like and kindly link to the 
     original page or the print edition. Please include TIMOTHY C. MAY 
     whenever quoting him from this book. Tim asks in his Cyphernomicon 
     not to put any other name on his words but his, and we ought to 
     respect that.

1.2. Forward

 	   Coming soon (tm).

1.2.1 Stucture and Contents

      I've organised this book as an A-Z lexicon of Timothy C. May's most 
	    interesting, insightful, and inflammatory online email and forum 
	    writing. This writing spans the course of over a decade as has hithero 
	    been difficult to access because it is scattered across thousands of 
	    emails on old forum archives. I've left out his stand-alone pieces like 
	    The Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto or the Cyphernomicon because they are 
	    better read in their entirety on their own.
