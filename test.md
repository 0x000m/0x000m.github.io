### Deryk Makgill

I'm a self-taught software developer and sysadmin from New York exiled to the wilds of central Pennsylvania. I build cathedrals on quicksand from blueprints scribbled on bar napkins, and more often than not the result works.

### MORE ABOUT ME

I'm a husband, cat friend, and co-protector of a great big trauma puppy that my wife rescued from a shelter. My wife and I met on a Yahoo! forum in 2000, met in person for the first time in 2002, and got married in 2004. In the meantime we courted via email and instant messaging with weekly phone calls. We've been through a lot together, and while I had some doubts before I got married I have no regrets.

### ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

This is a "shinobi" website[2], based on a project by Bradley Taunt[3]. Rather than clamoring for attention, it hides in plain sight. If you know how to find it, you can. Otherwise it abides in the shadows, ready to be seen when you are ready to see it.

Likewise for my posts; if you know how to use a RSS reader you can follow me by adding one of the feeds listed above to your feed reader. If you're on a Mac like me I recommend NetNewsWire[4].

By way of disclosure: my site is hosted by NearlyFreeSpeech.net[5].

This site's public git repository is available at <https://git.sr.ht/~starbreaker/matthewgraybosch.com>.

### PRIVACY POLICY

I don't want your data. I don't collect your data. You should not get any cookies while visiting this website, there are no analytics, and I have access logging disabled when not debugging technical issues.

### ADVERTISING POLICY

I do not host advertising of any kind here. There is no sponsored content on this website. My personal website is not a billboard.

I will never host advertising here. It doesn't cost me much to operate this website, so I can easily pay the expenses out of the salary I get from my day job.
