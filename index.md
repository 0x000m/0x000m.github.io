I'm best known for my 2017-2019 writings on Bitcoin and before that,
my work with Praxis.


K&R
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's (K&R) "The C Programming
Language" teaches just that -- the C programming language. This is
*the* book to learn C, and C is a language that, in my opinion, every
programmer should know. The reason I say this is because there have
been very few really new languages since C -- most pretty much just
reinvent the wheel. I write it at the time where the languages people
are most excited about seem to be Rust, Go and (for whatever reason)
C#, so most definitely do learn C.


Algorithms and Data Structures
---------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of books on the subject, Niklaus Wirth's "Algorithms
and Data Structures" (also published under some different names) is
one of them. It's far less extensive than, for instance, CLRS, TAOCP,
or the wizard book, but it does offer pretty good explanations and
exercises in a pretty consise manner. Perfect when preparing for
exams/interviews/whatever.


Llama
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't even like Perl, yet to anyone who does I can most definitely
recommend Randal Schwartz's "Learning Perl" (the llama book). In one
sentence it's K&R but for Perl.


GOPL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Like "The C Programming Language," "The Go Programming Language" is
co-authored by Brian Kernighan, though the other author is, of course
not Dennis Ritchie, but Alan Donovan. Likely for this association the
book is also very infrequently called "K&D." As with most literature
Brian Kernighan had a hand in writing, the book is very thorough,
while also not too hard to understand, largely thanks to the good
exercises.
