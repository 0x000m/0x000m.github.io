ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
------------------

This is a "shinobi" website[2], based on a project by Bradley Taunt[3]. Rather than clamoring for attention, it hides in plain sight. If you know how to find it, you can. Otherwise it abides in the shadows, ready to be seen when you are ready to see it.

Likewise for my posts; if you know how to use a RSS reader you can follow me by adding one of the feeds listed above to your feed reader. If you're on a Mac like me I recommend NetNewsWire[4].

By way of disclosure: my site is hosted by NearlyFreeSpeech.net[5].

This site's public git repository is available at <https://git.sr.ht/~starbreaker/matthewgraybosch.com>.

"The more outlandish the typeface, the harder it is to read. The drama belongs in what you say, not the typeface"
> Ogilvy, D (1983), Ogilvy on Advertising pg. 96, London, Prion Books Ltd.
