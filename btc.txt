YOU SCREWED UP BITCOIN AND NOW YOU'RE SCREWED TOO

It’s hard to overstate what an incredible screw up it was for privacy to
turn Bitcoin into an investment asset and cripple its utility cash for
small/micropayents. 

Here’s how Bitcoin was intended to work. 

a. Miners mine Bitcoin. 
b. Miners use their coins to buy goods and services, especially 
   things they can't otherwise do without Bitcoin.
c. Good and service providers trade their coins to other service
   providers, peer to peer. 
d. Profit. We have an economy.

All of this is done totally privately without KYC or regulatory
oversight because people are just earning something for a good or
service they provide and trading it for another one.

Here’s how Bitcoin ended up working because short sighted devs and
exchange operators didn’t know what they were doing and thought that
Bitcoin wasn’t supposed to be cash.

a. Miners mine Bitcoin. 
b. Miners sell these Bitcoin on regulated KYC exchanges. 
c. People buy these Bitcoin on regulated KYC exchanges. 
d. People hold these Bitcoin and then sell them back to KYC
   exchanges.
e. Profit ??????? 

If Bitcoin had been usable as cash, and if people had understand that
intent and design of Bitcoin necessitated that it be cash, and not
whatever else they decide it is, we could have avoided, postponed, or
softened a lot of the dark stuff that is yet to come when everyone
wakes up to the fact that a majority of Bitcoin holders and users are
KYCd and will easily tracked and traced on-chain, censored, taxed,
etc.

As it is, it’s probably too late to avoid much pain. A lot of people
incorrectly believe they are safe and private with Bitcoin. They’re
going to learn otherwise the hard way one day soon.

Welcome to...reality.
