# TIMOTHY C. MAY: FROM 'ANARCHY' to 'WELFARISM'

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Copyright

<dl><dt>No rights reserved. Please use as you like and kindly link to the
original page or the print edition. Please include TIMOTHY C. MAY
whenever quoting him from this book. Tim asks in his Cyphernomicon
not to put any other name on his words but his, and we ought to
respect that.</dt></dl>

### 1.2. Forward

Coming soon (tm).

### 1.2.1 Stucture and Contents

<dl>
<dt>I've organised this book as an A-Z lexicon of Timothy C. May's most
interesting, insightful, and inflammatory online email and forum
writing. This writing spans the course of over a decade as has
hithero been difficult to access because it is scattered across
thousands of emails on old forum archives. I've left out his
stand-alone pieces like The Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto or the
Cyphernomicon because they are better read in their entirety on
  their own.</dt></dl>

### 1.3. Acknowledgements 

<dl><dt>All material is written by Tim May, except as noted. Research,
compilation, forward and editing by 0x000m. This work could not
have been done without access to the Cypherpunk Mailing List
plaintext archives of Ryan Lackey and their stylized archive on
  https://cryptoanarchy.wiki/ by Tom Busby.</dt>
