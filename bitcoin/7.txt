The transaction fees on Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV are not 
actually low, they're just subsidised by the block reward.

Miners can afford to provide block space nearly for free
only because they're able to pay for it through the current
inflation model. The actual cost of a Bitcoin Cash or a 
Bitcoin SV transaction then is actually much higher, it's
just that the costs aren't felt by users right now.

You're nodding your head saying you know this, but what you
have probably overlooked is that this subsidy is stopping
us from getting accurate information about what the proper
transaction fee is for the networks. People are building
businesses today that rely on low fees without knowing if
those fees will be sustainable for miners in the future!

For my own part, I think economies of scale can be achieved
and that fees could concievably go even lower than they are
today while miners become more and more profitable, but
I don't think we should keep kicking the can down the road
and hoping we turn out to be correct.

Let's remove the block reward today. There's no reason
Bitcoin needs to have 21 million coins. The number is 
arbitirary. Stopping it earlier just makes Bitcoin Cash
and Bitcoin SV more scarce than BTC, and it will kickstart
the process of the market figuring out what a sustainable
transaction fee actually is. It should also incentivize
miners and businesses to do the hard work that is necessary
to actually build a business that relies on high volumes
of low fee-paying transactions, whereas right now, miners
are fat and happy making money off their subsidy. 

We don't want to wait to figure this out. It will be painful.
We critize BTC devs a lot for imposing centrally planned,
short-sighted monetary policies, but the block subsidy has
become just that and we are hypocrites if we keep it. Enough 
coins have been distributed. Lets turn Bitcoin Cash or 
Bitcoin SV into the only chain that has a true free market 
for fees and see what happens.
