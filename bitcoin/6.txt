Total fees are nearly double the (BSV) block reward

Personally, I'm pulling out the champaign that market behaviour
is indeed producing activity levels that can pay for security 
without limiting the block size, and also producing no fee paying
backlogs that kill the usability of the chain.

I'd personally prefer that tis were done on BTC years ago because
I have to admit, the network effect is all there, but this new 2
gigameg block on BSV gives us a strong indicator that high volumes
of low fee transactions can more than make up for the block reward
as it moves closer to zero.

As Satoshi Nakamoto said, "I'm sure that in 20 years there will
either be very large transaction volume or no volume." More can be
done for education though——perhaps this market signal isn't efficient
yet. But we should get it there.
